# sbat-portal üöÄ‚ù§
Portal for client serive for a small company to see thier profiles.

# About Project Structure:
The project consist of two main projects:
- [backend](https://github.com/Takobz/sbat-portal/tree/master/backend/src) which is .NET WebAPI project
- [client](https://github.com/Takobz/sbat-portal/tree/master/client/src) which is React + Typescript project
- [database dir](https://github.com/Takobz/sbat-portal/tree/master/database) a simple nosql database used for testing, can be ignored.

The .NET Web API uses [Clean Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures) and a little bit of [Domain Driven Design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/net-core-microservice-domain-model) design patterns to saparate concerns. This project is by no means a perfect implementation of the mentioned practices and shouldn't be used as such.
